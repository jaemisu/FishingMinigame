this folder has the dll files required to be in any release folder in order to run the game locally in release x32 VS 2022

SFML 3.0.0 must also be located in your C:/ drive, also it's in .7z because .zip sucks, sorry to be unprofessional

these files are only required if you don't download the fully compiled version

cheers
